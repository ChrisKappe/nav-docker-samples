# nav-docker-samples
The idea of the samples in this repository is to change how the NAV Docker images work by just adding an env param which causes the container to download the given sample and put it in whichever folder you need. Check [my blog](https://www.axians-infoma.de/navblog/use-github-to-change-how-your-nav-on-docker-container-works/) to find out more

## Where are the samples?
Because of the way the .zip archives on GitHub work, I need to create a branch for every sample. Therefore, check all the branchs for the different samples.
